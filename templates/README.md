# makeit templates

Collection of makeit template that I personally use.

Templates might not be compatible with operating systems other then linux,
but I haven't tested that.

## How to get the templates?

You can manually insert all the folders to your makeit templates folder. By
default, it is located in the config folder (on linux
`~/.config/makeit/templates`).
